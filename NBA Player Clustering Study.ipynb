    "# NBA Player Clustering Study\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to determine statistically appropriate 'positions' or 'categories' of NBA players. NBA players are traditionally defined in 5 general categories: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center. However, the majority of NBA players are considered a blend of multiple positions (SG/SF, PF/C, PG/SG, etc.) and some coaches even simplify player categories into three broader categories: guard, wing, and big. This study will determine if there are statistically defined player categories via clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "If possible, this study will also attempt to determine which lineup combinations of player categories are most effective against other lineup categories.\n",
    "\n",
